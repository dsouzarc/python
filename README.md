##Misc. Python Files

Just a bunch of random Python files I made for various tasks.

Below is a BRIEF description of the programs I wrote. A more detailed description and comments can be found by viewing the actual file.
Some of these python programs might also be found in my 'dotfiles' repository on GitHub, which might be made public sometime soon.

##FlickrImageDownloader.py
Given the URL to a Flickr image that is not supposed to be downloaded, this Python script will access the FlickrAPI and download the image in the best quality available with the image title as the file name

##iOSAppIconResizer.py
Given an image name (or pointer towards image), this Python script will 
1. Create a new folder in that directory named 'App Icons'
2. Make a bunch of icons in different dimensions - all according to Apple's iOS UI design code - and save it with an appropriate title in the 'App Icons' directory as .png files
Though there are websites that do this, my Python script is faster and easier to use.
